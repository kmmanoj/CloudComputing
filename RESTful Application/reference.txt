### Creating a REST API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

Installing Node.js

Go to http://nodejs.org, and click the Install button.
Run the installer that you just downloaded. When the installer completes, a message indicates that Node was installed at /usr/local/bin/node and npm was installed at /usr/local/bin/npm.
At this point node.js is ready to use. Let’s implement the webserver application from the nodejs.org home page. We will use it as a starting point for our project: a RESTful API to access data (retrieve, create, update, delete) in a wine cellar database.

Create a folder named nodecellar anywhere on your file system.
In the wincellar folder, create a file named server.js.
Code server.js as follows:

```
var http = require('http');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(3000, '127.0.0.1');
console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
```

We are now ready to start the server and test the application:

To start the server, open a shell, cd to your nodecellar directory, and start your server as follows:
node server.js

To test the application, open a browser and access http://localhost:3000.


####Installing Express

Express is a lightweight node.js web application framework. It provides the basic HTTP infrastructure that makes it easy to create REST APIs.

To install Express in the nodecellar application:

In the nodecellar folder, create a file named package.json defined as follows:
```
{
    "name": "wine-cellar",
    "description": "Wine Cellar Application",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "private": true,
    "dependencies": {
        "express": "3.x"
    }
}
```

Open a shell, cd to the nodecellar directory, and execute the following command to install the express module.
npm install

A node_modules folder is created in the nodecellar folder, and the Express module is installed in a subfolder of node_modules.

Now that Express is installed, we can stub a basic REST API for the nodecellar application:

Open server.js and replace its content as follows:

```
var express = require('express');
 
var app = express();
 
app.get('/wines', function(req, res) {
    res.send([{name:'wine1'}, {name:'wine2'}]);
});
app.get('/wines/:id', function(req, res) {
    res.send({id:req.params.id, name: "The Name", description: "description"});
});
 
app.listen(3000);
console.log('Listening on port 3000...');

Stop (CTRL+C) and restart the server:
node server
```

To test the API, open a browser and access the following URLs:
Get all the wines in the database:	http://localhost:3000/wines
Get wine with a specific id (for example: 1):	http://localhost:3000/wines/1


####Using Node.js Modules

In a large application, things could easily get out of control if we keep adding code to a single JavaScript file (server.js). Let’s move the wine-related code in a wines module that we then declare as a dependency in server.js.

In the nodecellar folder, create a subfolder called routes.
In the routes folder create a file named wines.js and defined as follows:
```
exports.findAll = function(req, res) {
    res.send([{name:'wine1'}, {name:'wine2'}, {name:'wine3'}]);
};
 
exports.findById = function(req, res) {
    res.send({id:req.params.id, name: "The Name", description: "description"});
};
```

Modify server.js as follows to delegate the routes implementation to the wines module:

```
var express = require('express'),
    wines = require('./routes/wines');
 
var app = express();
 
app.get('/wines', wines.findAll);
app.get('/wines/:id', wines.findById);
 
app.listen(3000);
console.log('Listening on port 3000...');
```

Restart the server and test the APIs:
Get all the wines in the database:	http://localhost:3000/wines
Get wine with a specific id (for example: 1):	http://localhost:3000/wines/1
The next step is to replace the placeholder data with actual data from a MongoDB database.


####Installing MongoDB

To install MongoDB on your specific platform, refer to the MongoDB QuickStart. Here are some quick steps to install MongoDB on a Mac:

Open a terminal window and type the following command to download the latest release:
curl http://downloads.mongodb.org/osx/mongodb-osx-x86_64-2.2.0.tgz > ~/Downloads/mongo.tgz

Note: You may need to adjust the version number. 2.2.0 is the latest production version at the time of this writing.

Extract the files from the mongo.tgz archive:
cd ~/Downloads
tar -zxvf mongo.tgz

Move the mongo folder to /usr/local (or another folder according to your personal preferences):
sudo mv -n mongodb-osx-x86_64-2.2.0/ /usr/local/

(Optional) Create a symbolic link to make it easier to access:
sudo ln -s /usr/local/mongodb-osx-x86_64-2.2.0 /usr/local/mongodb

Create a folder for MongoDB’s data and set the appropriate permissions:
sudo mkdir -p /data/db
sudo chown `id -u` /data/db

Start mongodb
cd /usr/local/mongodb
./bin/mongod

You can also open the MongoDB Interactive Shell in another terminal window to interact with your database using a command line interface.
cd /usr/local/mongodb
./bin/mongo

Refer to the MongoDB Interactive Shell documentation for more information.



####Installing the MongoDB Driver for Node.js

There are different solutions offering different levels of abstraction to access MongoDB from Node.js (For example, Mongoose and Mongolia). A comparaison of these solutions is beyond the scope of this article. In this, guide we use the native Node.js driver.

To install the the native Node.js driver, open a terminal window, cd to your nodecellar folder, and execute the following command:

`npm install mongodb



Implementing the REST API

The full REST API for the nodecellar application consists of the following methods:

Method	URL	Action
GET	/wines	Retrieve all wines
GET	/wines/5069b47aa892630aae000001	Retrieve the wine with the specified _id
POST	/wines	Add a new wine
PUT	/wines/5069b47aa892630aae000001	Update wine with the specified _id
DELETE	/wines/5069b47aa892630aae000001	Delete the wine with the specified _id
To implement all the routes required by the API, modify server.js as follows:

```
var express = require('express'),
    wine = require('./routes/wines');
 
var app = express();
 
app.configure(function () {
    app.use(express.logger('dev'));     /* 'default', 'short', 'tiny', 'dev' */
    app.use(express.bodyParser());
});
 
app.get('/wines', wine.findAll);
app.get('/wines/:id', wine.findById);
app.post('/wines', wine.addWine);
app.put('/wines/:id', wine.updateWine);
app.delete('/wines/:id', wine.deleteWine);
 
app.listen(3000);
console.log('Listening on port 3000...');
```

```
var mongo = require('mongodb');
 
var Server = mongo.Server,
    Db = mongo.Db,
    BSON = mongo.BSONPure;
 
var server = new Server('localhost', 27017, {auto_reconnect: true});
db = new Db('winedb', server);
 
db.open(function(err, db) {
    if(!err) {
        console.log("Connected to 'winedb' database");
        db.collection('wines', {strict:true}, function(err, collection) {
            if (err) {
                console.log("The 'wines' collection doesn't exist. Creating it with sample data...");
                populateDB();
            }
        });
    }
});
 
exports.findById = function(req, res) {
    var id = req.params.id;
    console.log('Retrieving wine: ' + id);
    db.collection('wines', function(err, collection) {
        collection.findOne({'_id':new BSON.ObjectID(id)}, function(err, item) {
            res.send(item);
        });
    });
};
 
exports.findAll = function(req, res) {
    db.collection('wines', function(err, collection) {
        collection.find().toArray(function(err, items) {
            res.send(items);
        });
    });
};
 
exports.addWine = function(req, res) {
    var wine = req.body;
    console.log('Adding wine: ' + JSON.stringify(wine));
    db.collection('wines', function(err, collection) {
        collection.insert(wine, {safe:true}, function(err, result) {
            if (err) {
                res.send({'error':'An error has occurred'});
            } else {
                console.log('Success: ' + JSON.stringify(result[0]));
                res.send(result[0]);
            }
        });
    });
}
 
exports.updateWine = function(req, res) {
    var id = req.params.id;
    var wine = req.body;
    console.log('Updating wine: ' + id);
    console.log(JSON.stringify(wine));
    db.collection('wines', function(err, collection) {
        collection.update({'_id':new BSON.ObjectID(id)}, wine, {safe:true}, function(err, result) {
            if (err) {
                console.log('Error updating wine: ' + err);
                res.send({'error':'An error has occurred'});
            } else {
                console.log('' + result + ' document(s) updated');
                res.send(wine);
            }
        });
    });
}
 
exports.deleteWine = function(req, res) {
    var id = req.params.id;
    console.log('Deleting wine: ' + id);
    db.collection('wines', function(err, collection) {
        collection.remove({'_id':new BSON.ObjectID(id)}, {safe:true}, function(err, result) {
            if (err) {
                res.send({'error':'An error has occurred - ' + err});
            } else {
                console.log('' + result + ' document(s) deleted');
                res.send(req.body);
            }
        });
    });
}

```

```
 
/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
// Populate database with sample data -- Only used once: the first time the application is started.
// You'd typically not find this code in a real-life app, since the database would already exist.
var populateDB = function() {
 
    var wines = [
    {
        name: "CHATEAU DE SAINT COSME",
        year: "2009",
        grapes: "Grenache / Syrah",
        country: "France",
        region: "Southern Rhone",
        description: "The aromas of fruit and spice...",
        picture: "saint_cosme.jpg"
    },
    {
        name: "LAN RIOJA CRIANZA",
        year: "2006",
        grapes: "Tempranillo",
        country: "Spain",
        region: "Rioja",
        description: "A resurgence of interest in boutique vineyards...",
        picture: "lan_rioja.jpg"
    }];
 
    db.collection('wines', function(err, collection) {
        collection.insert(wines, {safe:true}, function(err, result) {});
    });
 
};

```

Restart the server to test the API.



Testing the API using cURL

If you want to test your API before using it in a client application, you can invoke your REST services straight from a browser address bar. For example, you could try:

http://localhost:3000/wines
You will only be able to test your GET services that way. A more versatile solution to test RESTful services is to use cURL, a command line utility for transferring data with URL syntax.

For example, using cURL, you can test the Wine Cellar API with the following commands:

Get all wines:
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:3000/wines

Get wine with _id value of 5069b47aa892630aae000007 (use a value that exists in your database):
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:3000/wines/5069b47aa892630aae000007

Delete wine with _id value of 5069b47aa892630aae000007:
curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/wines/5069b47aa892630aae000007

Add a new wine:
curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name": "New Wine", "year": "2009"}' http://localhost:3000/wines

Modify wine with _id value of 5069b47aa892630aae000007:
curl -i -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name": "New Wine", "year": "2010"}' http://localhost:3000/wines/5069b47aa892630aae000007
